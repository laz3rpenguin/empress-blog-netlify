### It's that time of year again

Apple have finally seeded iOS 13 as a [Public Beta](https://beta.apple.com/). Although I have had iOS 13 since the first developer build, it is now much easier for people to get their hands on, as it doesn't require a Mac anymore.

I deployed the Beta onto my iPhone 7, this is my daily driver phone, and while people don't recommend doing this, it was essentially the only device I could run it on that wouldn't be too mission-critical. At the time of writing, my device is currently running Developer Beta 2, which is the same build as the first Public Beta seeded by Apple.

#### Performance & Battery Life

On the whole, I'm actually really happy with the performance and battery life of the device. 
The battery inside my iPhone 7 has a battery health of 78% (needs to be replaced soon), but the iOS 13 upgrade bought new life into the battery. I was at the stage where I had to carry around a power-bank to charge my phone more than once a day. I comfortably get through a full day on Developer Beta 2. Beta 1's battery life was not nearly as good, however this was expected as it is pre-release software.
Performance is great, everything feels a lot faster, and most definitely snappier. Apps load way faster, to the point where the loading is not even noticeable. I found that the performance of iOS 13 just leaves iOS 12 behind in terms of overall speed.

#### App Support

Everything is pretty smooth, I haven't really noticed any persistent bugs with 3rd Party Applications on iOS 13, most of the occasional bugs just went away after either a reboot, or an update to the app. I have yet to notice any bugs that completely hinder usability with Apps in iOS 13.

#### Bugs

For a Beta, I have been surprised with the lack of bugs within a day to day workflow. That isn't to say that there are a few. In Developer Beta 2, the Spotlight Search stops yielding Apps in any search. For me, this is a major issue as I tend to use the Spotlight Search to navigate my phone as most of my apps are haphazardly arranged or in folders. 
Also, there is a problem in the Beta where 3D Touch compatible devices don't actually use the force sensors in the devices, and instead just have the 'hold' gesture to invoke the context menu. Personally, I am not a fan of this, I like the force gesture and the associated haptic feedback. Apparently, Craig at Apple has stated that this is a bug and will be patched in later builds, which is good.     

#### Conclusion

All in all, I would completely recommend to deploy iOS 13 on at least one device. While not being the easiest to undo, it is definitely not permanent and if you're not a fan, you can downgrade back to iOS 12 and wait for the Public Release in September. Just remember to make a backup of your device, in the event that anything goes wrong, you can easily restore all of your data. Lots of people say that you shouldn't deploy it on a main device - I tend to disagree, I did it on my main device and I love it, but there are mixed opinions and mixed results so your mileage may vary.
